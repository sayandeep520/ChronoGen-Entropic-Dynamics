      PROJECT CHRONOS: FINAL DISCOVERY CERTIFICATE
============================================================
1. Critical Phase Transition: t ~ 24h (Delayed Rupture)
2. Mean Entropy (Shock):      13.4551 (High Dissipation)
3. Mean Entropy (Memory):     12.6697 (Structure Formed)
4. Thermodynamic Cost:        0.7855 bits
============================================================
SCIENTIFIC CONCLUSION:
The organism exhibits a 'Delayed Entropic Rupture'.
It resists stress for 12h, collapses at 24h (The Spike),
and then crystallizes into a low-entropy memory state.
