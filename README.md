# ChronoGen-Entropic-Dynamics
Validating the Law of Chrono-Entropic Parity: A computational framework revealing a "Delayed Thermodynamic Rupture" (t=24h) in Arabidopsis stress response. Includes the ChronoGen v1.0 library, tensor network pipelines, and the mathematical proof that biological memory acquisition is strictly bounded by thermodynamic dissipation.
